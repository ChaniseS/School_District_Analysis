# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis:

The School District report is used to show a high-level view of the schools’ key metrics, which includes but not limited to, the Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate, and School performance based on the budget per student, school size, and type of school. And lastly, we were asked to provide evidence of academic dishonesty from Thomas High School specifically.

## How is the District Summary affected?
When comparing the two reports, it doesn’t look like the School District was affected.

## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Looking at the data and comparing the two, it doesn’t look as though the math and reading scores were affected. Thomas High School still comes in at #2 in the Top 5 compared to the other schools.

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
	- The Math and Reading scores for the 10th - 12th graders were not affected by the changes to the 9th grade scores.
- Scores by school spending
	- The school spending was not greatly affected either. It looks as though this is done by the number of students and we didn’t the number of students. We just removed their related grades.
- Scores by school size
	- The scores by school size remained the same as well.
- Scores by school type
	- The scores by school type remained the same as well.

## Summary:
The purpose of the second analysis was to see if there was some academic dishonesty going on. To be honest, once I compared and reviewed both reports, the data didn’t make any drastic changes. Even though we didn’t remove any students (meaning lower the student count), we can see that none of the data changed or made a significant difference in the numbers.
